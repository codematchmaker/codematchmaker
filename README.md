# About me

Hi! I'm Maria Camila   
I believe recruitment is less about checklists, and more about discovering where people truly belong. Guided by curiosity, presence, and genuine human connection.
I work closely with developers and tech professionals to help them discover roles where they can **grow**, **feel valued**, and **build meaningful things**.
